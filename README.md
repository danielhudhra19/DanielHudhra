This is my repository for a task in "Software Engineering" course in Riga Technical University. Its purpose is to deepen my understanding in Git and GitHub.
----After commiting the changes----
In general, in my restaurant management system, there are two kind of employees that can access it: 
The boss (administrator) -->
•	He can open (i.e supervise) windows "Users", “Items", "Category".
-	In the "Users" window, he adds a new waiter, giving him username, password, etc.
-	In the "Items" window, he adds a new item to his restaurant, and this item appears in the "Billing" table when opened by a waiter.
-	In the "Category" window, he adds a new food category, for example "Seafood".
•	He cannot do the billing (he cannot open the “Billing" window).
Waiters (users) -->
•	They can do the billing for the items added by the admin and also print the invoice.
Waiters have the possibility to view their own bill they have generated, but the administrator may also generate reports.
